# Data Model
Written: 2024-07-19 
Author: Team Osprey

Team Osprey is endeavouring to determine a Minimum Viable Dataset for the backcountry reservation component of the PRDT Project. This document is a first pass at that MVD and is intended to be iterated on. 

### Goal
The goal of this document is to outline the datapoints that will most likely be necessary to move forward with the backcountry reservation component. If the new reservation wishes to support a certain 'experience', _ie_ allowing users to reserve a tentpad in the Garibaldi backcountry, then the experience must satisfy all mandatory datapoints of the MVD.

## Minimum Viable Dataset
The MVD is the scope of data that encompasses the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the same or greater level of service than the existing system on an experience-by-experience bases. The data that the MVD contains are prime candidates for storage in a data registry, in that they do not change frequently, are largely time-independent, contain no personally identifying information and are referenced by potentially many different consumers. Some categories of data in the MVD are:

* Inventory
* Permits
* Policies
* Operating Schedules
* Places

## Inventory
Inventory refers to a BC Parks asset provided for camper use. It is the most granular item or offering provided by BC Parks. They are typically physical resources but may also pertain to intangible items like a backcountry registration permit or ‘passport’, which only provides permission for a user to enter the backcountry but does not include any physical reservations. Inventory may be limited/finite, as is the case with tentpads, or unlimited/infinite, as is the case with some backcountry registration permits/passports. Inventory that can be reserved by users may only be held by at most one user at a time. Some inventory may also have geospatial properties. If ownership of the inventory must be tracked, such as in the case of reservations, then the inventory can belong to a [**permit**](#permits_) that will govern how it is allotted to campers.

Some quick examples of inventory are:

* a single, specific tentpad 
* permission to enter the backcountry at a specific location
* a bunk in a shelter
* a food cache or outhouse

### Inventory Data Properties
All permits inherit the properties from [base data type](#base-data-properties).
|**Property Name**|**Property Type**|**Definition**|**Mandatory?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|geo|`GeoJSON`|Valid geoJSON describing the geospatial features of the inventory|N|
|latitude|`Number`|The latitude of the inventory|N|
|longitude|`Number`|The longitude of the inventory|N|
|geohash|`String`|Minimum 4 point precision geohash of the place|N|
|isFinite|`Boolean`|Whether or not the inventory belongs to a finite set|Y|
|isReservable|`Boolean`|Whether or not the inventory is reservable|Y|
|parentPermit|`Permit`|The permit that handles the allocation of the inventory. See [**permits**](#permits)|N|

## Permits
A permit is a physical or digital document that gives someone permission to do something or be somewhere at a certain time. It may additionally permit someone to use BC Parks [**inventory**](#inventory) during that time, possibly exclusively. They exist to give BC Parks a record of who has permission to do something or be somewhere or use which inventory at some point in time. They link specific users to specific inventory. 

Permits are created from configuration templates governed by [**policies**](#policies), which dictate when the permission is available to someone, how much permission costs, and other information. Each configuration template has an **operating schedule** and also belongs to a [**place**](#places).

Some examples of permits include:

 - A backcountry reservation for 2 tentpads for 2 specific nights at a specific location
 - A backcountry registration permit for 3 specific nights permission to stay in the backcountry of a specific park
 - A day-use pass for a specific day to a specific location

### Permit (config) Data Properties

All permits inherit the properties from [base data type](#base-data-properties).
|**Property Name**|**Property Type**|**Definition**|**Mandatory?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|operatingSchedule|`OperatingSchedule`|The schedule of operation for the permit. See [operating schedule](#operating-schedule)|Y|

|partyPolicy| `PartyPolicy`|The permit's governing party policy. See [party policy](#party-policy)|Y|
|inventory|[`Inventory`]|A list of inventory controlled by the permit|N|



## Policies
Policies are rulesets that control how inventory is made available to users, how users can claim and exchange inventory, and how much users will pay for their inventory.

Certain policies are the same for many [**permits**](#permits), hence policies being their own entity, rather than baked into the properties of permits. 

All policies inherit the properties from [base data type](#base-data-properties).

### Booking Policies
Booking policies define how inventory is made available to users and how users are able to claim inventory. They involve details like how long in advance a user is able to book a certain date, how long they are allowed to claim the inventory for, and when the user is expected to use their inventory by.

|**Property Name**|**Property Type**|**Definition**|**Mandatory?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|minStay|`Duration`|The minimum duration a user is permitted to book at once|Y|
|maxStay|`Duration`|The maximum duration a user is permitted to book at once|Y|
|resWindowType|`String` or `Enum`|The type of advanced booking window, 'rolling' or 'fixed'|Y|
|rollingWindowDuration|`Duration`|The duration of the rolling window|N|
|fixedWindowOpenDate|`DateTime`|The datetime after which a user is permitted to book|N|
|openBookingTime|`Time`|The time of day after which a user is permitted to book|Y|
|closeBookingTime|`Time`|The time of day after which a user is no longer permitted to book for that day|Y|

|checkOutTime|`Time`|The time of day after which a user must have vacated/given up their inventory|Y|
|noShowTime|`Time`|The time of day after which a user is considered to have no-showed if they have not already checked in.
|allDatesBookedIntervals|[`Interval`]|Intervals of dates within which a user cannot book a portion of dates - that is, if any date of their booking coincides with a date in `allDatesBookedIntervals`, they must also book all of the other dates within the `Interval`. Common on holiday weekends.|N|

### Change Policies
Change policies define how users are able to change existing claims they may have on inventory. Cancellations fall within change policies as the user is still changing an existing claim they have by returning all their claimed inventory to the system. 
|**Property Name**|**Property Type**|**Definition**|**Mandatory?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|areChangesAllowed|`Boolean`|Is the user permitted to change their inventory?|Y|
|changeWindowDuration|`Duration`|The duration prior to the first date of a booking where a user is penalized in addition to change fees for making changes to their inventory. Before this window, changes and cancellations receive a full refund less change fees|Y|

|inWindowNightsForfeit|`Number`|The number of nights worth of fees forfeit in addition to cancellation fees if the user makes changes within the change window|Y|
|sameDayNightsForfeit|`Number`|The number of nights worth of fees forfeit in addition to cancellation fees if the user makes changes on the same day of their scheduled arrival|N|
|isFeeWaivedInWindow|`Boolean`|Is the change fee waived if the user makes a change within the change window (applicable to canoe circuits)|N|


### Fee Policies
Fee policies define how users are charged for their inventory, and if/how they are refunded in the event of a change or cancellation.

|**Property Name**|**Property Type**|**Definition**|**Mandatory?**|

|unitTransactionFee|`Number`|Fee per unit of inventory in the transaction, in dollars|N|
|maxTransactionFee|`Number`|Upper limit of transaction fees per transaction, in dollars|N|

### Party Policies
Party policies dictate how user's camping parties are allowed to be composed. They limit the number of people in the party and how many people are allowed to be allotted per unit inventory.

## Operating Schedule*
\*Operating and reservable dates is currently being researched by OXD and has a September 2024 deadline. Operating schedule data modelling is pending the outcome of this research.

An operating schedule provides a daily breakdown of [**inventory**](#inventory) availability and governing policies. To be absolutely certain of which policies are applicable on which days, it is better to store this data explicitly rather than implicitly. This means that for every day of the year, for every piece of inventory, there should be granular policy and availability data, as opposed to having complicated rulesets that apply across many days and having the system infer the policy and availability data on the fly. 

Having ~365 operating schedule datapoints per inventory instance per year may seem counter-intuitive as it balloons database size, but high volume of data is not a problem for NoSQL databases like DynamoDB and replication of data is actually best-practice. 

## Places
Places are geospatial entities with a somewhat fixed, physical extension. They can be represented as a point (lat/long), a polyline, or a polygon (area). They are usually identified and specified by some given name. Some examples of places are:

-   parks/protected areas (polygon)
-   campgrounds (point)
-   wilderness camping regions (polygon)
-   trails (polyline)
-   timezones (polygon)

Places can have at most 1 parent place and zero to many child places. For example, Bear Beach is a place (point) within Juan de Fuca Park. The Juan de Fuca Trail (polyline) is also a place within JDF Park. JDF Park is a place (polygon) within the North Island section. The North Island section is a place (polygon) within the West Coast region.

Each place must have a point representation if it is not already defined by a point. For polygons, this may be the centroid. For polylines, this may be a midpoint or a terminal point on the line (like a trailhead) that best represents the place. This point is used to determine several things, like the location where icons will be rendered for the place and which timezone the place belongs to.
